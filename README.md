# OpenGL Engine

An OpenGL-based game engine developed from scratch, focusing on low-level graphics programming and engine architecture.

## Features

- **Low-Level OpenGL Rendering**: Direct interaction with OpenGL for rendering, providing full control over graphics pipeline.
- **Custom Shaders**: Support for custom GLSL shaders to achieve advanced visual effects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang).
- **OpenGL**: The engine requires OpenGL
- **GLFW**: For creating windows and handling input.
- **GLAD**: For loading OpenGL function pointers.
